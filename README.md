Stuff for Korg Volca Drum

I wish there was a possibility to send patches to the computer. There is the pacth editor from OscillatorSink (https://github.com/oscillatorsink), but thats only from Editor to the Volca Drum and I tend to fiddle on the VD itself and enjoy this more than sliding on a screen.
